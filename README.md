### Cards Against Humanity Political Affiliation Prediction
This project aims to predict the political affiliation (Democrat, Republican, or Independent) of individuals using data from the Cards Against Humanity (CAH) Saves America poll.

### Data Source
Cards Against Humanity, a well-known board game company, conducted the CAH Saves America campaign in 2017, which included a series of politically-related activities. As part of this campaign, they partnered with Survey Sampling International, a professional research firm, to collect data from a nationally representative sample of the American public.

The poll consisted of monthly surveys that included both silly and serious questions about the world. The data analysis conducted by CAH can be accessed on their website: thepulseofthenation.com. You can refer to their analyses to gain insights and inform your own analysis. However, please note that some questions have been omitted or edited for the purpose of this project.

It's important to highlight that while the data collection process was conducted by a neutral party, the discussion on the CAH website reflects the company's opinionated views. The inclusion of their website is purely for informational purposes and does not imply an endorsement of their messages.

### Goal
The primary objective of this project is to develop a predictive model that can determine the political affiliation of an individual based on their responses to the CAH poll questions. By leveraging the provided dataset, we aim to create a model capable of accurately categorizing individuals as Democrats, Republicans, or Independents.

Please note that the success of this project depends on the quality of the data and the features used for prediction. Additionally, this analysis is meant for educational and exploratory purposes and does not intend to make definitive political conclusions
